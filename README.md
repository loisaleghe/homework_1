# homework_1

Updates made in the assignment:
1.  I added a header to the site header as a semantic tag, it seemed reasonable since there was a footer tag
2.  Changed the footer to h3 because there was no sequence of how the tags went from h1 to h2 to h3 then back to h2
3.  I added an ID to the #search-engine-optimization div tag because when I clicked on it before, it wasn't working 
4.  I added alt to all the images to describe them in case a picture doesn't load 
5.  I also updated the title name to make it sound more descriptive 
6.  I deleted the "/img" closing tag because I thought it was redundant
